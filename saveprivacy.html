            <h3>Relevant legal bases:</h3> <br>
            <p>In accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, we inform you of the legal bases for our data processing activities. If the legal basis is not 
                mentioned in the privacy policy, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consent is Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 of the 
                GDPR, the legal basis for processing for the performance of our services and carrying out contractual measures as well as responding 
                to inquiries is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, the legal basis for processing for compliance with our legal obligations is Article 6(1)(c) of 
                the GDPR, and the legal basis for processing for the protection of our legitimate interests is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. In the event 
                that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(d) of the GDPR 
                serves as the legal basis.</p> <br> <br>

            <h3>Security measures:</h3> <br>
            <p> In accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR, we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of 
                security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, 
                and purposes of processing as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p> <br> <br>
                
            <h3>Collaboration with processors and third parties:</h3>
            <p> If, in the course of our processing, we disclose data to other individuals and companies (processors or third parties), transmit it to 
                them, or otherwise grant them access to the data, this is done only on the basis of a legal permission (e.g., if a transfer of data to 
                third parties, such as payment service providers, is necessary for the performance of a contract pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR), if you 
                have consented, if a legal obligation provides for it, or based on our legitimate interests (e.g., when using agents, web hosts, etc.).</p>
